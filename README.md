# Crew AI Basic

Crew AI Basic is a simplified AI framework designed to help developers build and deploy AI models with ease. This project focuses on providing a basic structure for AI projects, allowing users to focus on developing their models without worrying about the underlying setup and configuration.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend and customize different parts of the framework.
- **Pre-built Components**: Common AI components such as data processing, model training, and evaluation are already included.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design to help developers get started quickly.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for a variety of AI applications, from simple experiments to more complex models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheCoder30ec4/Crew_AI_Basic.git
   cd Crew_AI_Basic
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Configure Your Project**:
   - Modify the `config.py` file to set up your project parameters, including data paths, model parameters, and training options.

2. **Prepare Your Data**:
   - Place your dataset in the appropriate directory specified in `config.py`.
   - Ensure your data is formatted correctly for the model you intend to use.

3. **Train Your Model**:
   - Run the training script to start training your AI model.
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. **Evaluate Your Model**:
   - After training, evaluate your model using the evaluation script.
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

5. **Deploy Your Model**:
   - Use the deployment script to deploy your trained model.
   ```bash
   python deploy.py
   ```

## Project Structure
